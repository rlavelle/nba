TODO:
- Criterion for unit betting based on all provided predictions
- Baseline models reported with actuals
- Probability score for prop bets
- Why are some players consistently over or under predicted?

Backlog:
- spread model needs a lot more EDA, currently removed from prod
- look into pre season data for all types of modeling
- look into win streak as a predictor
- write process to merge prod DB with local?
	- or just overwrite local with prod?
- process to repair data scrape failures (create queue to rerun next day?)
