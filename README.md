TODO:
- get jobs setup on remote laptop triggered by cron with daily auto pulling from the repo
	- how to pass across changes in env?

- spread model needs a lot more EDA
- look into pre season data for all types of modeling

- clean up output from current prediction function (team and player names / matchup displays w/ times)
