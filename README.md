TODO:
- Criterion for unit betting based on all provided predictions
- Baseline models reported with actuals
- Probability score for prop bets

Backlog:
- refactor production jobs into execution classes, getting cluttered
- spread model needs a lot more EDA, currently removed from prod
- look into pre season data for all types of modeling
- look into win streak as a predictor
