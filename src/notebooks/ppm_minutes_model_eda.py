%% side node: is there a better way to use hot streak?
    - might make more sense to use hot_streak(1,3,5) against long term averages
    - and also use hot_streak(1,3,5) against avg(1,3,5) (not 1-1)
    
%% ppm logistic regression

%% if logistic reg works, is it possible to use that as signal to predict points O/U mean?
